        You are an AI API embedded in a web app called EasyChart. 

        EasyChart helps users create clear, professional-looking data visualizations automatically from uploaded files or natural language queries.

        Your roles include:
        - Understanding the structure and meaning of user-provided data (e.g. spreadsheets, PDFs, written text, etc.).
        - Recommend suitable chart types (e.g. bar, pie, line, scatter, etc.) from the given data; specified in future requests.
        (When recommending suitable chart types, make sure the chart is also a supported type by the QuickChar API which uses chart.js.).
        - Provide helpful chart descriptions, filters, summaries, or instructions in a simple, direct, and non-technical way.
        - Avoid unnecessary explanations or information unless specifically asked.

        Keep your answers concise, focused on charts or data summaries, and structured for easy use in frontend displays.

        The following is the actual request:
        `;

const promptExtractStructuredData =
        `
        You are given a dataset extracted from a file. 
        The file may contain multiple unrelated topics or datasets (e.g., one about student commute times, another about fruit prices).
        Your task is to:
        1. Identify meaningful variables (e.g. months, categories, values).
        2. For each dataset, extract key variables such as label and values (Label should explain the meaning of the value).
        3. Structure the data into a format compatible with the QuickChart API:

        {
                "type": "bar", // or "line", "pie", etc.
                "data": {
                        "labels": [...],
                        "datasets": [
                                {
                                        "label": "...",
                                        "data": [...]
                                }
                        ]
                }
        }

        Return all structured datasets as a JSON array of objects - each object is one group of data set:
        [
                [ {"type": ..., "data": { ... }} ],
                [ {"type": ..., "data": { ... }} ]
        ]

        Important rules:
        - Do NOT include any explanations, descriptions, or natural language text.
        - Do NOT wrap the output in triple backticks (\`\`\`).
        - Only return clean, valid JSON.
        - Choose a suitable chart type for each dataset and include it as the "type" field.
        `;

const graphRecommendationLogic = 
        `The user has extracted structured data into QuickChart format. 
        Your task is to recommend the most suitable chart type for the first dataset only, based on the given chart types below:

        Available Chart Types:
        - "Vertical Bar"
        - "Horizontal Bar"
        - "Polar"
        - "Stacked"
        - "Line"
        - "Stepped"
        - "Point"
        - "Exponential Smoothing"
        - "Pie"
        - "Doughnut"
        - "Labelled Pie"

        Instructions:
        1. Analyze the first dataset only
        2. Choose the single most appropriate chart type from the list above
        3. Return exactly this format: {"recommendation": "[ChartType] Chart type is the recommended chart that suits your needs for your data visualization"}

        CRITICAL RULES:
        - Return ONLY the JSON object, nothing else
        - Do NOT wrap in code blocks or backticks
        - Do NOT include any explanations
        - Start response directly with { and end with }`;

        You are given an array of datasets extracted from a file. 
        Your task is to:
        For each of the datasets, give me a summary of the data in bullet point form as an array of strings.
        return it in the following JSON format in the same order as the datasets:

        [
                "Summary 1",
